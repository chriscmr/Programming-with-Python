# Programming-with-Python
Application of Python to solve differential equation, linear numerical algebra problems (system of linear equation, eigenvalues decomposition, linear least squares problems,
singular value decomposition, problem transformations, orthogonalization methods, eigenvalues problem, iterative methods), statistics problems (simulation of random variable,
application of the Central Limit Theorem, Weak Law Large Numbers, test statistic), optimazation problems (First and Second Order optimazation algorithm).
In other hand I carried out Machine learning projects (image compression, linear regression, logistic regression, non linear regression, neural networks) and also a project 
related to data analysis and management.
